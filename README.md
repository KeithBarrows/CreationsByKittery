Welcome to the CreationsByKittery!  More details on the [Wiki](https://github.com/KeithBarrows/CreationsByKittery/wiki)

This is a website I am creating for my wife, which gives me the opportunity to look at changing some things up.  
* [Feature folders](http://timgthomas.com/2013/10/feature-folders-in-asp-net-mvc/) in an MVC app
* [Put your controllers on a diet](https://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/2013/12/19/put-your-controllers-on-a-diet-posts-and-commands/): POSTs and commands
* [CQRS and MediatR](https://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/2015/05/05/cqrs-with-mediatr-and-automapper/)
* [Dependency Injection with StructureMap](https://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/2010/04/27/dependency-injection-in-asp-net-mvc-controllers/)
